## Project Status
Current status of the project: _completed but with room to grow_

## Room for Improvement and Development
At the moment, some image files need improvement. They do not all have the same extension. The extension of the project logo needs to be changed to a file with the extension .svg. In addition, the frames for the animations contained in the ScrollingSection need to be created in order to provide the right fluidity for them.

Room for improvement:
- Implementation of automatic filter for images with page color
- Optimization and improvement of minor bugs.

To do:
- Implementation of using to store database data instead of constants in a file.
- Creation of a page for adding projects consisting of a clean project page with buttons for adding data.
- Filling in the page with real data instead of filling in from the page that inspired the design.
